# [Harmonic Oscillator](http://drknotter.github.io/harmonic-oscillator)

I created this small demonstration of a mass-spring system the first time I taught introduction to differential equations. I wanted to to demonstrate how the motion of a mass-spring system is affected by its three main parameters: the mass, the spring constant, and the damping coefficient. You can change these parameters in the text boxes, and click-drag the mass to observe the effects. The blue line represents the position of the mass, and the green line represents its velocity.
